## Rules:
- The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.
- You and a friend of yours each will choose whether "X" or "O". Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.
- The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.
- When all 9 squares are full, but no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.
